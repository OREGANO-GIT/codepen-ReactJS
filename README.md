# codepen
 A basic Codepen using React JS


In the files uploaded , in the src folder ,the inbuilt files have been deleted and I have created the new files on my own.
In the index.html file in the public folder , there exists the id-"root" in which basically make all the xml files to be deployed.

I have created hooks for the styling of the buttons in the codepen editor.
All the 3 codepen editor have been refelcted in the Editor.js file which we are imported from the App.js files which in turn is imported by the index.js file.
Also,the styling for both the editors and the display result part has been done.

I used the codemirror library for supporting the basic functionality of the editor i.e.-HTML,CSS,JS.
I have also mades use of ControlledEditor imported from "react-codemirror2' which saves the code written and remains same the next time you visit for your own simplicity.
I have imported some files like @fortawesome/react-fontawesome for the basic view of the O/C button in the codepen which we generally see in some that we use.

How to run the project -

1.Open your terminal.
2.Go to the folder where all your files are loaded using Cmd using cd/Desktop/codepen(or whatever yor folder destination is).
3.now type "npm start".
4.This will direct to your browser where you can see the entire project been loaded.
5.You can change the code and write whatever HTML,CSS or JS you write and it will display the result of your code down below as expected.
